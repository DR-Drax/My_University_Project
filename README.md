# My_University_Project
<<<<<<< HEAD
Small pastime repo with utilities for university tasks and hobby projects while I learn Python libraries like SymPy, Matplotlib, and more. Work in progress: some features unfinished, others still need a user interface.
=======
*A personal collection of small Python utilities built to practice—and apply—concepts learned in class.*

---

## Overview
This repository is organized into **five categories**.  
Each folder contains one or more programs that tackle a different engineering problem or demonstrate a specific technique.

| Folder | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **`Cinematica_Mecanismo/`** | Generates cam profiles from a target trajectory and basic kinematic parameters. Includes simple plotting for visual validation. |
| **`Formulary/`** | A grab-bag of math helpers: unit-conversion widgets, common engineering formulas, and a few numerical-methods demos (e.g., Newton–Raphson). |
| **`Digital_Systems/`** | Scripts that *write* other scripts (code-generation). Example projects:<br>• Produce VHDL to scroll a name across a 7-segment display.<br>• Auto-generate state-machine templates with any number of states. |
| **`Py_Tools/`** | My personal Python mini-library: type-checking utilities, input validators (int/float/string), and miscellaneous helpers used across the repo. |
| **`…`** | *(Two additional folders reserved for future coursework—stay tuned.)* |
